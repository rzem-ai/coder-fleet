# SubagentStop: two jobs.
#
#   1. The board write. status failure or cancelled moves the item to Blocked.
#      status success with one or more "Blocker:" lines under Decisions needed
#      moves it to Blocked by human. A clean success changes no column -
#      TaskCompleted owns Done.
#
#      Every one of those three outcomes also puts a comment on the card, so a
#      row says what happened instead of only which column it is in. The text is
#      lifted from the handoff the agent already emits and from the status the
#      harness already sends: "## Done" on a clean finish, "## Not done" plus the
#      status on a failure or cancellation, the Blocker lines on the human queue.
#      Nothing new is asked of the handoff format - no fifth heading, no fourth
#      prefix - because a field agents have to remember is a field that decays,
#      and only the mandatory sections are worth building on.
#
#      The "## Done" comment is posted here rather than from TaskCompleted for
#      the plain reason that TaskCompleted never sees a handoff. It owns the move
#      to Done; this hook owns the only moment the text exists.
#
#      A handoff long enough that its comment will not fit on a card is archived
#      whole under the state directory before the cut text is posted, and the cut
#      note names the file. This hook holds the whole handoff in $message and is
#      the last thing that ever will, so anything it drops is gone. See
#      hooks/README.md, "Comment length".
#   2. The handoff-format check. On a successful run the final message must be
#      a valid handoff per skills/handoff/SKILL.md. If it is not, exit 2, which
#      stops the subagent stopping and hands the reason back to it. The rules
#      are strict on purpose and are the same rules evals/lib/handoff-check.sh
#      applies in CI: see hooks/README.md, "The handoff-format check".
#
# Every board failure is soft. The only thing that exits 2 here is a malformed
# handoff, and it exits 2 for that reason alone - never because the board could
# not be written.

# re-emit a handoff they were never asked to write. Scoping the matcher (item
