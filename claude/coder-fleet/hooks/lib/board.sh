# is an exit code with its own stderr rather than an errors array smuggled

# from its input - and an inherited CLAUDECODE_AGENTS_BOARD_ROOT is left alone
# for the contract suite and the rare deliberate override. There is no default
# root and no fallback board: outside a repository the binary says "no board
# here", the hook logs it, and nothing moves.
