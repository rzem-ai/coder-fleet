# per-agent half of that lives. It switches on agent_type and denies the tool
# calls the agent's own Invariants section forbids, quoting the invariant back
# so the agent knows which line it hit.
#
# It fails open. A bug here must not stop the fleet working. Be clear about what
# that costs: for the per-agent half there is no second lock, because that is the
# half permissions.deny cannot express. The session-wide half - credentials,
# curl, sudo, destructive git - is denied in settings and by the sandbox whatever
# this hook does, and the sandbox is the thing that actually contains an agent.

# --------------------------------------------------------- quoting the command
# Quoting a word does not change which command the shell runs. Adjacent quoted
# and unquoted pieces are joined into ONE word before the shell decides what to
# execute, so `""git`, `''git`, `g""it`, `"g"it`, `gi''t` and `"git"` are all
# the word `git` - verified by running each of them, not assumed - and so is
# `b""ash`. Two characters were enough to retire the refuter's git rule,
# coder's worktree guard, ui-designer's install ban and fleet-steward's merge
# ban at once, because every one of those is a targeted check rather than a
# command allowlist: `bash -c "\"\"git commit -m x"` recovered a payload whose
# leading token read as `""git`, which matches no branch, and a real shell ran
# git commit.
#
# The quotes come off here, before anything else reads the string, because that
# is the one place that serves leading_token, sub_verb and install_verb at the
# same time - and because strip_quoted, further down, ERASES a quoted span, so
# by the time a segment exists the `g` of `"g"it` is already gone and no
# per-parser fix could get it back.
#
# Only INERT quotes go: a span whose content is empty or is made entirely of
# the characters a command name or a plain path can hold. Everything else keeps
# its quotes, because for everything else the quotes are load-bearing -
# `grep -R '=>' src`, `find . -name "*.ts"` and `git commit -m "a message"` all
# depend on strip_quoted still erasing that span, and unquoting them would hand
# a redirection, a glob or a word split to a check that would then deny honest
# work.
#
# The backslash-escaped forms go first and in the same pass, because that is
# how the shape arrives from an interpreter payload: the recovery below appends
# a payload exactly as written, backslashes intact, so the pair to remove in
# `bash -c "\"\"git commit"` is `\"\"` rather than `""`.
#
# A lone escaped quote that is left over then has to be hidden from the plain
# rules, or they pair it with the real quote that follows and eat the payload's
# terminator: `bash -c "git commit -m \"a b\""` would lose its closing quote,
# the recovery would find no terminated payload, and a command that denies
# today would allow. Hence the two placeholders. A guard on the pattern instead
# (`(^|[^\\])"`) was tried and is wrong for a different reason: consuming the
# preceding character stops adjacent pairs matching, so `""""git` collapsed one
# pair per pass and stayed `""git`.
#
# The placeholders are two control bytes, and a command that already contains
# one has it handed back as `\"` or `\'`. That is not a way through: the shell
# has no meaning for those bytes either, so a word holding one names a command
# that does not exist, whichever of the two ways this reads it.
#
# An ODD number of quotes is deliberately left alone. `bash -c "\"\"\"\"\"git
# commit -m x"` leaves the payload unterminated and a real shell refuses to run
# it - "unexpected EOF while looking for matching quote" - so denying it would
# add a case no real command can reach, which is the same stance this file
# already takes for a lone unterminated quote. Removing pairs leaves the odd
# one standing, the leading token stays `"git`, and nothing fires.
#
# What this is not: a shell. It reads a quote as inert on the content between
# it and the next one of its kind, with no notion of which quote is inside
# which. That is the same trade the rest of this file makes, and it errs the
# safe way - an unrecognised shape keeps its quotes and is erased by
# strip_quoted exactly as it was before.

# Every enforce_* function below finds its segments the same way: strip_quoted
# erases quoted spans, THEN the result is split on shell operators. That order
# is exactly what let `bash -c "git commit -m x"` past every check that is not
# a plain command allowlist - strip_quoted turned the payload into
# `bash -c ""`, so the leading token of every segment was "bash", and no
# per-verb rule (the refuter's git rule, coder's worktree guard, ui-designer's
# install ban, fleet-steward's merge/push ban) concerns itself with bash. An
# allowlist role such as scout or reviewer is untouched either way, because
# bash and sh are not on their allowed-commands list and they deny on the
# outer segment before a payload would ever matter.
#
# The fix recovers the payload BEFORE strip_quoted runs, from the raw string,
# and appends it as its own newline-separated line, so it is picked up by
# every function's existing segment scan without any per-role change. The
# original segment is left in place and is still scanned as written; only the
# payload is added, never removed. This does not run a shell and is not a
# parser - it looks for the one shape named here and nothing cleverer, the
# same stance the rest of this file takes (see sub_verb's header comment).
#
# Two things one keystroke away from the plain shape are folded in rather
# than left as a second hole: a path-qualified interpreter (`/bin/bash -c`)
# is recognised on its basename, the way leading_token recognises one
# elsewhere in this file - the boundary check accepts "/" as well as
# whitespace and the shell's own operators immediately before the name, so
# it need not be spelled out as its own alternative. And bash reads its
# script from the next argument for any short-option cluster ending in `c`,
# not only the bare flag - `-lc`, `-ec`, `-xc` are all "-c plus something
# else", so the cluster is matched rather than the literal two characters.
# `env bash -c "..."` was already covered before either of those two
# changes: the boundary before "bash" is the space after "env", and that
# space does not care what token preceded it.
#
# Interpreters covered: bash, sh, zsh, dash, ksh, plain or path-qualified.
# Known and deliberately uncovered: a payload built from a variable
# (`bash -c "$VAR"`), `eval`, a heredoc, and a flag cluster that is not the
# interpreter's first argument (`bash --rcfile x -c "..."`, `bash -x -c
# "..."` as two separate arguments rather than one cluster). Each is a
# genuine gap; this hook is a role reminder, not a containment boundary, and
# none of the four can be closed by pattern-matching the command string.
#
# Also deliberately uncovered: an unterminated quote, e.g.
# `bash -c "git commit -m x`. A real shell rejects that with "unexpected EOF
# while looking for matching quote" and never runs it, so treating it as a
# bypass would add a case no real command can reach.
#
# A single pass over the whole string finds every SIBLING occurrence - two
# unrelated `-c` invocations side by side - but not a NESTED one, because the
# recovered payload of `bash -c "sh -c 'git commit -m x'"` is itself
# `sh -c 'git commit -m x'`, and a real shell runs that nesting exactly as
# written. So the single pass below is repeated over whatever the previous
# pass just found, until a pass finds nothing new, capped at a small fixed
# number of passes rather than "until empty" so a command built to nest the
# same shape many times cannot turn this into a loop. The cap bounds the work.
# It is NOT what bounds the depth, and an earlier version of this comment said
# it was - it claimed the cap caught two levels and no more, and that raising
# it would only move the limit from depth three to depth four. That was wrong
# in both halves: depths four through ten deny today, and the one shape that
# was escaping had nothing to do with the number of passes.
#
# What actually bounds the recovery is ESCAPING. A recovered payload is
# appended exactly as it appeared in the command, without undoing the
# backslash escapes a real shell strips when it reads that payload. So a quote
# still carrying its backslash is invisible to the next pass: the pattern
# below looks for a real `'` or `"` after the `-c`, and `\"` is not one.
#
# The rule that falls out of that is about quoting, not about how many
# interpreters are stacked:
#
#   Caught, however deep, when the innermost payload is single-quoted - the
#   levels above it never had to escape those quotes, so they survive as real
#   quote characters for a later pass to find. Verified to ten levels:
#     zsh -c "sh -c \"bash -c 'git commit -m x'\""
#
#   Not caught, when reaching the innermost payload would mean unescaping a
#   layer first:
#     sh -c "bash -c \"git commit -m x\""
#     bash -c "sh -c 'sh -c \"git commit -m x\"'"
#
# Closing those would mean unescaping each recovered payload between passes.
# That is a real option, deliberately not taken: it is another step further
# into emulating a shell, and it would buy nothing against someone actually
# trying, who has `bash -c "$VAR"`, `eval` and a heredoc available - all
# simpler to write than an escaped nesting, and none of them closable by
# pattern-matching the command string at all (see the uncovered-gaps list
# above). Restated once more because it is the premise this whole function
# rests on: this hook is a role reminder, not a containment boundary.
#
# The double-quoted alternative in the pattern is therefore escape-aware -
# `"([^"\\]|\\.)*"`, which ends only on an unescaped quote - while the
# single-quoted one stays `'[^']*'`. That asymmetry is deliberate and matches
# the shell: inside single quotes a backslash is not an escape, so `'a\b'` is
# a complete literal that ends at its closing quote. The same escape-aware
# form appears twice below, once in the grep pattern and once in the small
# regex that strips the quotes off a match; both must agree, or the match
# succeeds and the payload comes back empty.
#
# The single pass finds every occurrence with grep, not with a bash `while
# [[ =~ ]]` loop that peels one match off the front and re-searches the
# remainder. That first version was correct but not linear: advancing past a
# found match used `${rest#*"$match"}`, and bash's own glob-pattern removal
# for a leading-wildcard pattern against a long string is quadratic - each
# call rescans from the start, so N matches (or one match near the end of a
# long, otherwise-unmatching string) cost O(length^2). Measured: a 100
# thousand character command took over 14 seconds against this hook's own 10
# second timeout, and a command that exceeds the timeout renders no decision
# at all - for every governed role, not only the one that triggered it. The
# regex match itself was never the slow part; a command with no interpreter
# shape in it stayed fast at any length, which is what pointed at the
# advance-the-cursor step rather than the search. grep finds every
# non-overlapping match in one linear pass and prints each one on its own
# line; the second, small regex below only ever runs against one already-found
# match, never against the original string, so nothing here is proportional
# to the command's length except the one initial grep.

# ------------------------------------------------------------- the scan bound
# Every enforce_* branch below reads a command the same way: strip the quoted
# spans, split the result on the shell's operators, then walk each segment.
# That work is superlinear in the length of a segment, and this hook is
# registered in hooks.json with "timeout": 10. Measured end to end on
# `bash -c "` + N x `\"` + `git commit -m x"`, before this bound:
#
#     command   refuter   coder   ui-designer
#      16 KB      1.2s     1.2s      1.3s

#      64 KB      6.4s     6.3s      9.1s
#      80 KB      9.4s     9.0s     13.6s   <- ui-designer already past the timeout
#
# A hook that blows its timeout renders no decision at all, so a single absurd
# command does not merely evade the role that was slow - it turns every guard
# off for that call, for every role. That is the failure this bounds against.
#
# The length is bounded at 8192 bytes, because: the longest command in this
# repo's entire eval corpus is under 200 bytes; a deliberately generous real one
# - a long commit message, a find with a dozen paths - is a few hundred more;
# and nothing a person or an agent types comes near 8 KB.
#
# What that bound does NOT do is keep the hook fast. Length is not the cost.
# The table above is a single segment, where the parsing is paid once; the cost
# is dominated by how many segments there are, because every segment pays six to
# ten subprocess spawns of its own through leading_token, command_words,
# unescape_words and sub_verb. Measured after the byte bound shipped, scout:
#
#     200 x `git log` chained with `;`   2000 bytes    13.8s
#     200 x `ls -la`  chained with `;`   1800 bytes     9.6s
#
# Both are a quarter of SCAN_MAX and both reach the 10 second timeout. So the
# segment count is bounded too, below, and the two bounds are separate because
# they bound different quantities.
#
# Truncating is not skipping, and the difference matters. The head of the
# command is still scanned, so `git commit -m x && <80 KB of padding>` is
# still caught; skipping the checks on an over-long command would catch
# nothing and would make length itself the bypass. What a truncated scan
# gives up is a verb hiding past the bound, which is a real gap and is the
# price of not having the timeout take every role's guard down with it.
#
# The bound is applied twice, because there are two texts and either can be
# the long one: the command as submitted, and the interpreter payloads
# recovered from it. Bounding only the first would let a command just under
# the bound recover several times its own length. So the scanned text is at
# most two bounds' worth, whatever the input.

# The command a segment actually runs: leading VAR=value assignments dropped,

# Wrappers the shell runs straight through: the real command is what follows.
# A closed list, because it costs no false denies - unlike treating any token
# that matches a forbidden verb as one.
# NOT sudo. Transparency is asymmetric: for a denylist role it stops a forbidden
# verb hiding behind the wrapper, but for an allowlist role it removes the
# requirement that the wrapper itself be permitted - and `sudo cat` is not the
# same act as `cat`. Listing it here let `sudo cat /etc/shadow` past scout's
# allowlist, which had refused it purely because sudo was not on the list.
# permissions.deny backstops sudo, but the per-agent layer is precisely the half
# permissions.deny cannot express, so it should not be the looser of the two.
#
# NOT `script` either, and for the same asymmetry rather than a different one.
# `script cat` does not run cat: it starts a shell and writes the typescript to
# a file called `cat`. Making it transparent would hand scout a way to create a
# file, which is exactly the sudo shape. It closes nothing in return, because
# the form that runs a command - `script -q /dev/null git commit` - has the
# typescript file between the wrapper and the command word, so the token is
# `/dev/null` either way. It stays on the open-items list instead.
#
# The five additions are scheduling wrappers, and they are transparent in the
# sense that matters: `nice cat x` is the same act as `cat x`, none of them
# writes anything of its own, and each was confirmed to actually run git.
COMMAND_WRAPPERS=" command env builtin exec nohup time xargs timeout nice stdbuf setsid ionice "

# Shell syntax that can legally sit in front of a command word, which the shell
# consumes before it decides what to run. leading_token read the first of these
# AS the command name, so `{ git commit -m x; }`, `( git commit -m x )`,
# `! git commit -m x`, `>/tmp/out git commit -m x` and the body of any if, for
# or while had a command word that no rule was looking for - which retires the
# refuter's git rule, coder's worktree guard, ui-designer's install ban and
# fleet-steward's merge ban all at once, the same four the quoting work above
# exists to protect. Every form was confirmed to actually run git.
#
# Stripped in a loop, because they stack: `then ! >/tmp/x git commit -m x` is
# one segment with three of them in front. Only ever at the FRONT of a segment,
# so nothing that is an argument is touched.
#
# What it does not reach is command substitution. `$(git commit -m x)` has no
# leading token to remove - the `$` is part of the word - so it stays open for
# every role without a substitution check of its own, which is refuter, coder
# and ui-designer. That is on the open-items list rather than papered over here.
#
# No subprocess: this runs once per segment, and the segment bound above exists
# because per-segment spawns are what reach the hook's timeout.
# The closers are here too, and not for symmetry. Splitting `{ ls -la; }` on the

# that segment because `}` is not a command it may run - so a brace group around
# a plain read was refused for the wrong reason. A segment made only of closing
# syntax is not a command at all, and after the strip it is empty and skipped.

#
# This is the only place that can PREVENT a fix landing in the main checkout.
# review-round can detect it afterwards - by then coder has already branched and
# committed - and the fix prompt asks coder to check first, but an instruction
# is not a boundary. coder carries an agentType, so this hook governs its Bash
# calls, and git itself answers the question: a linked worktree's git dir is
# under `.git/worktrees/`, a main checkout's is not.
#
# Reads are untouched. So is everything that is not git. What is refused is a
# git command that writes, in a directory that cannot be shown to be a worktree
# - including a directory that is not a repository at all, where such a command
# would fail anyway. Not being able to tell is not permission: the whole point
# is the case where isolation silently did not happen, which is exactly when
# nothing announces itself.
#
# scripter is dispatched here too. It is coder's cheaper sibling with the same
# isolation: worktree and the same invariant, and nothing below reads the agent
# name - the decision rests only on the command, its cwd and what git says the
# target directory is - so one guard serves both.
