/**
 * Task ids in every ref the clone knows about, read-only. A separate
 * `git ls-tree` per ref (from `for-each-ref`) would spawn one subprocess per
 * branch on every id allocation - hundreds of them in a repository with
 * hundreds of remote-tracking refs, in the same process as the web server.
 * `git log --all --name-only --diff-filter=A --format=` instead walks the
 * history reachable from every ref in a single subprocess and prints every
 * path ever added anywhere in that history. A file added on some ref and
 * later deleted or archived still printed here, so its id still counts as
 * occupied - conservative, and exactly what allocation wants: an id must
 * never be reused just because its file moved or vanished. No fetch: what
 * the clone has not seen it cannot consult, and that is the accepted limit.
