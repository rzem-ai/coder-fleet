# Compound

At the end of a unit of work, some of what you learned is worth more than the work. This is the step that moves it somewhere it will be read again, and throws away the rest. Both halves matter - a rules directory nobody trusts is worse than an empty one, because it costs context on every matching turn and buys nothing.

## When to run

Run once, on a unit of work that is finished and verified. A merged plan phase, a review round that closed, a debugging session that ended in a fix, a spec the human approved.

Do not run it mid-work, do not run it per turn, and do not run it just because a session is ending. Work that failed or was cancelled produces no learnings, only guesses, and an unverified run is the worst possible source for a rule that will be believed by everything that comes after it.

## What is worth keeping

Three tests, all three or it is not a learning.

**It surprised you.** You got it wrong first, or you had to go and find out. Something you already knew before the task started is not a learning.

**It will recur.** You can name the next situation where it applies. If the only place it is true is the file you just edited, the code says it better than a rule can.

**It is durable.** It will still be true next month. Anything tied to a branch, a ticket, a version you are about to upgrade or a person's current opinion goes stale faster than anyone will notice it has.

Most units of work produce zero or one learning. Three is the ceiling for a single run, and hitting it repeatedly means the tests are being applied too generously.

Never keep a restatement of the task, a summary of what you did, a fact the code or a type already states, or anything the glossary, CLAUDE.md or an existing rule already says.

## Where each kind goes

| Kind of learning | Home | Note |
|---|---|---|
| A convention this project follows | `.claude/rules/<topic>.md` | Add a `paths:` glob if it only applies to some files. A rule without one loads on every turn, so earn it |
| A fact that must be true on every turn and fits in a sentence | `CLAUDE.md` | Under 200 lines, facts only, never a procedure |
| A repeatable procedure, multi-step, worth following again | a skill under `claudecode-agents/skills/` | Edit an existing skill before you add a new one |
| A durable decision about the work, and why | the shared memory corpus | Only `researcher` and the lead can write there. Everyone else writes a `Propose memory:` line and one of them files it |
| Work you noticed but did not do | a board item | A `Propose item:` line under Decisions needed. The lead files it. Never a rule |

The commonest mistake is filing a procedure as a rule. If it has steps, it is a skill. If it is one sentence a reader either obeys or does not, it is a rule.

The second commonest is writing a memory that is really a rule. Memory answers "what did we decide about this last time" across projects and sessions. A rule shapes what happens in this repo without anyone asking. When both fit, prefer the rule, because it applies itself.

## The discipline

Search before you write. Every new file competes with the ones already there, and two rules that half agree are worse than one that is out of date, because a reader has to decide which is live.

Edit before you add. Updating an existing rule or skill is almost always the right move, and a new file needs a reason you would defend.

Delete on contradiction. When a learning contradicts something already written down, change the old text. Never leave both and never soften the old one into something that no longer says anything.

Every addition carries one line of provenance - the date and the unit of work it came from - so anything unreferenced can be found and pruned later without archaeology. The lead re-reads `.claude/rules/` on the quarterly pass, below, and deletes what has not earned its place.

Nothing here writes to the board, and nothing here is a substitute for the handoff. If a learning is important enough to act on now, it is a line under Decisions needed, not a file somebody might read.

## Archived runs

When a board comment was too long for the card, the hook wrote the whole thing to `~/.local/state/claudecode-agents/archives/<session-id>/<timestamp>-<agent>.md` and the card names the file. Those archives are the fullest record of what a run actually said, and a run only produces one because it had more to say than a card holds, so read the ones for the unit of work you are compounding before concluding there was nothing to keep.

Nothing prunes that directory and nothing backs it up. A run worth keeping permanently gets promoted into the repo - as a rule, a skill, or a `Propose memory:` line - and moving the file itself is a human's call, not yours. A state directory is not storage.

## Run articles

A run article under `docs/runs/` is the other raw material and usually the better one: where an archive is a verbatim comment a hook had to cut, an article is an account of the run written for the next person, with the dead ends already named. Read the ones for the unit of work you are compounding before you list candidates, because half the learnings are often sitting in "what was tried and abandoned", still owing you the three tests.

What happens next differs. An archive is promoted or forgotten. An article is in the repo, versioned, and pruned on the same quarterly pass as `.claude/rules/` - delete one whose code no longer exists, because anything in it worth keeping became a rule, a skill or a memory here first. The `run-article` skill is how one gets written.

## The quarterly pass

The human asks for it; nothing schedules it. When they do, the lead runs this skill in reverse over one project repo: every file under `.claude/rules/` and every article under `docs/runs/` is read against the three tests as they stand today, and one that now fails a test is deleted rather than softened. A rule whose subject left the code, an article about a run whose code no longer exists, a memory-shaped rule that a later decision superseded - all go, because git holds the text and a directory nobody trusts costs context on every turn. Anything in a doomed file still worth keeping is promoted first, the same way a fresh learning would be. The deletions go under Done in the lead's handoff with a one-line reason each, so the pass leaves a record of what was judged and why.

## How you work

1. Name the unit of work in one sentence and confirm it landed and was verified. If it did not, stop.
2. List the candidate learnings, plainly, before judging any of them.
3. Apply the three tests to each and discard everything that fails. Say what you discarded, so the discarding is visible rather than invisible.
4. For each survivor, search `.claude/rules/`, the skills directory and the memory server for where it already lives.
5. Edit or add one file per learning, with its provenance line. Keep it as short as the thing allows.
6. Record it in the handoff - what you wrote goes under Done, a corpus entry you cannot write yourself is a `Propose memory:` line, and new work you noticed is a `Propose item:` line.
