name: board-conventions
description: How the board works - its projects and issues, the meaning of the five columns (to do, doing, blocked, blocked by human, done), which columns are written by hooks and which a human-facing assistant writes itself, the checkout's focus (`task_focus`, `/work`) that tells the hooks which issue the work is on, how the handoff's Decisions needed lines reach the human queue, and what earns a board item at all.
when_to_use: Read before filing, reading, moving, commenting on or closing any board item or project, before spawning a subagent against an item, before reporting board status to the human, and whenever you are deciding whether a piece of work is board work or just a task inside the session.

# The board

The board is this repository's: a directory of markdown files, one per item, at `.boards/tasks/` in the main checkout, committed like any other project file, and the board is those files grouped by status. It is written through the plugin's own `board` binary and never by hand, and the binary commits every write it makes. There is no global board; each repository has its own. Nothing sits between the board and Claude Code's native task list.

**Projects** - a project is the repository. The `project` field on an item is optional and exists for a monorepo that wants to say which part; there is no list to be on.

**Issues** - one issue per tracked unit of work, in a project, with milestones on the project where there is a real date, and sub-items as a parent task, `BD-12.1` under `BD-12`. The board is the five-column view over these issues. One repository, one board: what you see is this project's state and nothing else's.

## What earns an item

An issue in the glossary sense earns a task file on the board. That is the unit of work the human cares about, and it either has a spec or is trivial enough not to need one. A sub-issue earns an issue too and stays under its parent.

A Task in the glossary sense never appears on the board. Tasks are the execution layer inside a session, cheap and many, created with `TaskCreate` and dead when the session ends. One issue may spawn twenty of them and the board does not move. Sessions, phases, rounds, handoffs and reviews are not items either. If you are filing something to remember it for the next ten minutes, it is a task, not an item.

The lead files work that surfaces mid-run. An agent that spots adjacent work while doing a task does not file it itself: the work leaves the run as a `Propose item:` line under Decisions needed, and the lead files it when it merges the handoffs.

`fleet-steward` is the named exception, and the only one. Its sweep is scheduled and unattended rather than mid-run, and there is no lead in the loop to file for it, so proposing would mean a weekly run produced nothing at all until the human next started a session. It files what the sweep found itself, as items on the claudecode-agents repository's board. That is a licence to create issues and comment on them and nothing else: it still never edits a field, moves an issue or writes a state on one that already exists.

## The five columns

| Column | Means | Written by, in the fleet |
|---|---|---|
| To do | Filed, not started | The human, the lead filing a proposal, or `fleet-steward` filing its own scheduled sweep |
| Doing | An agent has picked it up | `SubagentStart` hook |
| Blocked | Waiting on something that is not the human - a build, an API, another item, or a run that failed or was cancelled | `SubagentStop` on status failure or cancelled, and `TaskCompleted` when tests fail |
| Blocked by human | Waiting on an answer from the human. The human queue | `SubagentStop`, on a `Blocker:` line in the handoff |
| Done | The run finished and its tests passed | `TaskCompleted` hook |

The columns are the `statuses` list in `.boards/config.yml`, spelled exactly as the table has them, and the hooks match them ignoring case. `board.env` overrides still exist for a tree whose config spells them differently, but the installer writes the fleet's spelling and nothing should need one.

Blocked and blocked by human are separate columns because they need different responses. Blocked is something to wait out or work around. Blocked by human costs the human an interruption, and it is the only column they monitor.

## Who writes the columns

Two environments share this board and they write it differently. Know which one you are in before you touch anything.

**In the fleet, columns are written by hooks and never by an agent.** Three hooks cover every transition in the table above, each calling the `board` binary against this repository's `.boards/`. So do not move an item, do not ask for one to be moved, and do not report that you moved one. The only thing you contribute is a correctly formatted handoff, because that is what the hook reads. An agent body or a run that tries to update a state is wrong even when the state it wants is correct. Filing a new issue is a different act from writing a column: a new item arrives in to do because that is where new items start. Moving one that already exists is the thing nobody but a hook does.

A comment ending in a `[Cut to fit a board comment ...]` line names a file under `~/.local/state/claudecode-agents/archives/<session-id>/` on the human's machine: that is the whole comment, written by the hook at the moment it cut it, and it is the only copy of the part the card is missing.

**In Cowork there are no hooks, so the assistant layer writes the board by instruction.** The assistant moves items itself, and the discipline the hooks provide has to come from three rules instead. First, move an item to doing when you actually start it and to done when it is finished and verified, in the turn it happens, never batched up at the end of a day. Second, the only thing that goes into blocked by human is something genuinely waiting on the human, with the reason as a comment on the issue. Third, never file an item for a step you are about to take in the same turn - that is a task.

## Telling the hooks which item

Hooks write the columns, but nothing tells a hook which issue a subagent is working on.

**The binding is the checkout's focus.** `SubagentStart` receives the agent's identity and nothing else - no spawn prompt under any name - so a line in the prompt cannot reach it. What it reads is `.boards/.focus` in the main checkout, one line, written by the `task_focus` tool or the human's `/work` command:

```
task_focus BD-12
```

Call it when you start a phase against an item, before the first spawn. Every spawn in that checkout then belongs to that item until the focus changes. Work on an unrelated item focuses that item first, and an unfocused checkout moves nothing - which is correct, because most spawns are not board work. `CLAUDECODE_AGENTS_BOARD_PAGE_ID` at launch still works and is read last; nothing asks anyone to set it.

**Completion is a separate question.** The binding says which item is in flight. It never says that a given task finished it, and `TaskCompleted` will not guess: only a task whose subject carries `[board:<issue>]` moves an issue to done, and that marker goes on the one task that represents completing the whole issue. An ordinary execution task carries no marker however much it contributed. A card that silently reads done is taken as finished work.

**The `Board-Item:` line is still worth writing, as context for the agent.** It tells the agent which issue it is working against so it can fetch it; it is not a hook transport, and it never was. Do not describe it as one.

```
Board-Item: BD-12
```

If a future runtime does send the spawn prompt to `SubagentStart`, the hook already reads it, and this is the format it accepts, as `hooks/lib/board.sh` parses it:

- The first matching line wins. Later ones are ignored, so one line per spawn.
- The label is case-insensitive and may be indented, and a leading `- ` is tolerated so the line survives being written as a list item. Nothing else may precede it on the line.
- The value is the first whitespace-separated token after the colon. Anything after it on that line is discarded, so do not append a title or a note.
- The value may be an item identifier in any case (`bd-12` resolves as `BD-12`), a sub-task id (`BD-12.3`), or the task file's path as the CLI or the web UI hands it back.
- A value in none of those shapes is not a ref. The line is then treated as absent, silently.

If you are the agent receiving the line, use it to fetch the issue you are working against; never treat it as permission to move a state. Columns belong to the hooks.

**Which spawns carry it.** Any spawn doing board-tracked work: a `coder` on a plan phase, a `reviewer` on that diff, a `spec-writer` interviewing against a filed item, a `ui-designer`, `tech-writer` or `researcher` commissioned against one. The test is whether the result belongs on an issue.

**Which legitimately do not.** A `scout` sent to find where something lives, or any agent spawned to answer a question inside the conversation, is not board work and gets no line. Neither is an exploratory spawn, a second opinion, or anything you would otherwise have done yourself in the main session. Most spawns are not items, per What earns an item above, and adding the line to a spawn that is not one drags a real issue into doing for work that is not it.

**What happens when it is absent.** `SubagentStart` logs that no board item was resolved, moves nothing, and exits 0. For a scout that is the correct outcome and the end of it. For real work it is a silent failure with a long tail: the issue sits in to do while the work happens, `SubagentStop` finds no binding so a failed run never reaches blocked and a `Blocker:` line never reaches blocked by human, and `TaskCompleted` falls back to a `[board:<issue>]` marker in the task title, then to the session's last item, then to nothing. No error is raised anywhere. The only evidence is a `no board item` line in `~/.local/state/claudecode-agents/log/hooks.log`.

**Two items in one session.** The `TaskCompleted` fallback guesses, and it guesses whichever item was picked up most recently. If a session is working two items at once, put `[board:<issue>]` in the task title as well and the guess never happens.

## Decisions needed and the human queue

Every handoff ends with a Decisions needed heading carrying typed lines, and only one of the three types touches the board.

`Blocker:` moves the item into blocked by human and the blocker text lands as a comment on the issue, so the queue answers what is blocked, on what, and for how long, without anyone opening a transcript. `Propose item:` becomes a new issue in to do, filed by the lead - or by `fleet-steward` for its own scheduled sweep, per What earns an item above. `Propose memory:` never touches the board at all - it is corpus work for the researcher or the lead.

A false blocker is not free. The queue is read out to the human twice a day, and anything sitting in it for more than four hours during working hours escalates immediately. Park a routine suggestion there and you have interrupted them for nothing; miss a real one and they never learn they were needed.

## Done, and the outcome

There is no success column. Done means the run finished and its tests passed, and nothing more. Whether the work was any good is recorded once the answer is known - usually later and often by the human - as an outcome label on the issue: `outcome/shipped`, `outcome/abandoned` or `outcome/superseded`. A label is queryable where a comment is not.

So an item that turns out to have been the wrong idea is done with `outcome/abandoned`, not dragged back into to do. Replacement work is a new issue, and the old one is `outcome/superseded`. A second terminal column is exactly where items go to be stranded, which is why there is not one.

## Item conventions

Title the issue as the change, in the imperative, in the glossary's words - "Rotate refresh tokens on reuse", not "refresh token stuff" and not "Investigate the auth epic". One item, one outcome. If an issue needs two answers to close, it is two issues or a parent with sub-issues.

The project field on an issue is optional: it names a part of a monorepo when there is one, and is otherwise left unset, because the project is the repository. A label naming the repo (`claudecode-agents`, `opencode-agents`) goes on the project, and on an issue only when the project spans repos. A milestone is set only when there is a real date or deliverable, not to express urgency.

Link `docs/specs/<issue>.md` and `docs/plans/<issue>.md` on the issue rather than pasting their contents into it. The repo is the source of truth for both and a copy on the issue goes stale silently.

Add comments, do not rewrite descriptions. The history of an issue is how a blocked item is understood a week later, and an edited description destroys it. Never delete an issue - abandon it.

## Git

Every write the binary makes is a commit: `git add -- .boards` then `git commit -- .boards` in the main checkout, on whatever branch is checked out there, with an imperative, unprefixed subject such as `Move BD-12 to Doing on the board` or `Create BD-12 on the board`, and who made the write in a `Board-Writer:` trailer (`Board-Writer: SubagentStart`), never in the subject. The pathspec keeps the human's own staged work out: everything outside `.boards` is left alone; anything inside it, staged or not, goes with the next board commit. Nothing pushes; the human's next push carries it. A commit that cannot be made - a locked index after three retries, a checkout mid-rebase, an ignored `.boards` - leaves the file write standing and logs `commit skipped`. Commits happen only when `auto_commit: true` is set in the config - an absent key means no commits - and `CLAUDECODE_AGENTS_BOARD_NO_COMMIT=1` turns them off for a shell.

A hook fired inside a coder's worktree resolves to the main checkout, so a feature branch never carries a board change unless a person put one there. Ids are allocated above the highest id in every branch the clone knows, so two contributors do not mint the same one; a clone that has not fetched cannot know, and that is the limit.

`git log -- .boards/tasks/BD-12*` is the history of an item: who moved it and when, which a comment trail can forget and a commit cannot.

## The CLI

Every write goes through the `board` binary, reached by the shim at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/board/board.sh`, against the main checkout of the repository containing the working directory (`CLAUDECODE_AGENTS_BOARD_ROOT` overrides that when set). This table exists rather than a pointer at the tool because nested `--help` fell through in the upstream tool the package was carried from, so "run `board task create --help`" was not an answer; the carried CLI does answer it, but a machine that has not built the binary still has to be able to read the flags here.

| Command | Flags |
|---|---|
| `board task create <title>` | `-d/--description text`, `-s/--status status`, `-a/--assignee names`, `-l/--labels labels`, `--priority p`, `--project name`, `--milestone m`, `-p/--parent id`, `--dep id`, `--ac text`, `--plan text`, `--notes text`, `--by <name>`, `--json`, `--plain` |
| `board task edit <id>` | `-t/--title text`, `-d/--description text`, `-s/--status status`, `-a/--assignee names`, `-l/--labels labels`, `--add-label l`, `--remove-label l`, `--priority p`, `--project name`, `--milestone m`, `--dep id`, `--ref text`, `--ac text`, `--check-ac n`, `--uncheck-ac n`, `--remove-ac n`, `--plan text`, `--append-plan text`, `--notes text`, `--append-notes text`, `--comment text` (needs `--comment-author @name`), `--final-summary text`, `--by <name>`, `--json`, `--plain` |
| `board task view <id>` | `--json`, `--plain` |
| `board task list` | `--status s`, `--project p`, `--assignee a`, `--labels l`, `--search q`, `--limit n`, `--json`, `--plain` |
| `board task search <query>` | `--type t`, `--limit n`, `--json`, `--plain` |
| `board focus [id]` | `--show`, `--clear` - this checkout's focused item |
| `board export` | none - the whole board as a markdown table on stdout |
| `board mcp` | none - the MCP server on stdio |
| `board serve` | `--port n`, `--host h` - random port on `127.0.0.1` unless overridden by the flag, `CLAUDECODE_AGENTS_BOARD_PORT`/`_HOST`, or `default_port` in the config |

`--dep`, `--ac`, `--check-ac`, `--uncheck-ac`, `--remove-ac`, `--ref`, `--add-label`, `--remove-label`, `--append-plan`, `--append-notes` and `--comment` repeat, as do `list --status` and `search --type`; `-a` and `-l` take a comma-separated list or repeat. `-s` on `create` and `edit` takes one status, not a list. `--json` returns a versioned document whose `kind` is `task-view`, `task-list` or `search`, and a comment's text is its `body` field. There is no `--cwd`: the board is found from the working directory through git, to the main checkout, never to a linked worktree's copy.

**When the tools are missing.** If `task_focus`, `task_view` and the rest are not among your tools, the board MCP server did not load in this session, and the plugin being enabled does not rule that out. Say so before doing anything else, and say why, checking in this order: the server is switched off for this project (`~/.claude.json` holds `disabledMcpServers` under `projects["<this project path>"]`; if it lists `plugin:claudecode-agents:board`, the `/mcp` toggle turned it off, and `/mcp` turns it back on for the next session - this is the common case); the plugin is not enabled here (`claude plugin list` from the project shows no enabled `claudecode-agents@rzem`); the binary is not built (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/board/board.sh --help` does not run). Then do the work through the CLI above: `board.sh focus <id>` writes the same `.boards/.focus` the tool does and the hooks read the file, not the tool, so the item moves just the same; `board.sh task view`, `list`, `search`, `create` and `edit` are the same operations the tools expose. An agent that reached the board this way says so in its handoff, as an Unverified line naming the cause, so the lead sees it and the human can fix it for the sessions that follow. Never fall back silently, and never decide the board is unavailable because a tool search came back empty - the CLI is always there.

**The web UI is per session, and optional.** The `/board` command calls the MCP server's `board_serve` tool, which starts the UI inside that session's own MCP process on a random loopback port and returns the URL; `board_url` reports it without starting anything. It stops when the session's MCP server stops. Nothing about the board depends on it: the task tools and the hooks read and write the files directly. Never start `board serve` from Bash as a substitute for `/board` - a server outside the MCP process outlives the session.
