# Handoff format

End every final message with a handoff. It is a machine contract, not a style guide: a `SubagentStop` hook parses `last_assistant_message` and, on a successful run, refuses to let you stop until it parses. Deviate and you are sent back to write it again. Get it subtly wrong and either a blocker is missed, so the human never learns they are needed, or a routine suggestion parks a false alarm in their queue. The eval gate in CI applies exactly the same rules, so a handoff that fails one fails the other.

## Structure

Four sections. Always these four, always this order, always all four present:

```
## Done
## Not done
## Unverified
## Decisions needed
```

Rules a `grep`/`sed` parser depends on:

- Heading lines are exactly `## ` plus the wording above. Level 2, one space, that capitalisation, no trailing punctuation, no numbering, no bold. Anchor: `^## (Done|Not done|Unverified|Decisions needed)$`, applied after every line is right-trimmed - trailing whitespace is invisible and never changes what a line means, but leading whitespace still does.
- Use no other level-2 heading anywhere in the final message.
- Every item is one markdown list item starting `- ` at column 0. No nesting, no sub-bullets, no code fences, no tables.
- No blank line inside a section. The only blank line the parser allows is the one before the next heading, as in the example below.
- One item is one line. Items never wrap - the newline ends the item. Keep each under roughly 200 characters; split a long one into two items.
- An empty section contains exactly one line: `- None`. Never omit a section and never leave one blank, so a parser never has to distinguish "no blockers" from "the agent forgot the section".
- The handoff is the last thing in the message. Nothing follows the last item of Decisions needed.

## What goes where

- **Done** - what you changed or established, with paths. Verified work only.
- **Not done** - in-scope work you did not finish, including anything stopped by a failure or a cancellation.
- **Unverified** - claims you could not prove: untested code, commands you did not run, assumptions you carried forward.
- **Decisions needed** - typed lines only, per below.

## Typed lines

Every line under Decisions needed carries one of exactly three prefixes. Case-sensitive, spelled exactly as written, colon then a single space:

- `- Blocker: ` - the work is stopped until the human answers. This and only this moves the board item into "blocked by human". Use it only when you genuinely cannot proceed; it costs them an interruption.
- `- Propose item: ` - suggested new board work. The lead files it. It never touches the human queue.
- `- Propose memory: ` - worth filing into the shared memory corpus. Only `researcher` and the lead can write there, so one of them actions it.

Anchor: `^- (Blocker|Propose item|Propose memory): `.

There is no fourth prefix and an untyped line is invalid.

A typed line belongs under `## Decisions needed` and nowhere else. Start a line with one of those three prefixes under `## Done`, `## Not done` or `## Unverified` and the whole handoff is malformed: the hook rejects it and asks you to send it again. It is not read from there and it is not quietly moved for you, because a blocker in the wrong section means the agent has the format wrong, and rescuing it silently would hide that from the human.

Both parsers anchor on the start of a line, so naming a prefix mid-sentence in prose costs nothing. What matters is where a line that *starts* with one appears.

## Do not signal status in the text

The harness sends `SubagentStop` no status field - not `success`, not `failure`, not `cancelled`; the shipped CLI's own schema has no such field, and the hooks were reading one that never arrived (see `hooks/README.md` item 15). So this handoff is the only account of the run that anything downstream gets. That does not mean inventing a status line, a "FAILED" banner or a truncated message: the four sections already say it. What went wrong goes under Not done, what you could not prove goes under Unverified, and anything that needs the human before the work can continue is a `Blocker:` line - which is the one route to the human queue that actually works.

## Example

```
## Done
- Added POST /sessions/refresh in src/api/auth.ts with rotation on reuse.
- Rotation unit tests pass: pnpm test src/api/auth.test.ts.

## Not done
- Rate limiting on the endpoint. Phase 3 of the plan, not started.

## Unverified
- Never exercised against staging Redis, only the in-memory fake.
- Assumed refresh tokens are single-use; the spec does not say.

## Decisions needed
- Blocker: Refresh token TTL is unspecified and phase 3 depends on it. 7 days or 30?
- Propose item: Migrate the legacy /token endpoint onto the same rotation logic.
- Propose memory: We chose rotation-on-reuse over sliding expiry for the project's services.
