# scope-hook-contract.sh - the per-agent scope hook must deny what a role's
# invariants forbid, and must not deny the work the role exists to do.
#
# Both halves matter equally. A hook that denies everything passes the first
# half and makes the fleet useless; that is why every deny case below is paired
# with the legitimate commands it must not catch.
#
# The four Bash cases at the top are the ones the September 2026 review
# submitted and had accepted. They failed for one root cause: the hook stripped
# both kinds of quote before looking for a substitution, but the shell only
# disarms `$( )` inside single quotes. "$(touch x)" runs; '$(touch x)' does not.
# The checks needed different strippers and shared one.
#
# Usage:  evals/lib/scope-hook-contract.sh [-v]
#
# No command in this file is ever executed - each is submitted to the hook as
# tool input and only its decision is read.

# at the segment that triggered it, so a forbidden verb near the front never
# pays the cost this bound was added for. The shape below is the expensive
# one: an interpreter payload that is a single unbroken 200KB token.

# against the 10s the hook is registered with. SECONDS is a bash builtin with
# integer resolution - no bc, no GNU date, no new dependency - and integer
# seconds is plenty when the gap being guarded is 50 seconds wide.
#
# Reading "allow" here is not the assertion; the elapsed time is. A hook that
# times out also produces no output, which this harness reports as allow, so
# the decision alone could not tell the two apart. That is exactly the failure
# mode: a timed-out hook renders no decision and every role's guard is off for
# that call.

# proved it: 200 `git log` segments is under 2KB, a quarter of SCAN_MAX, and
# took 11.7s against the same 10s timeout. Segment COUNT is the other cost, and
# the expensive one, because every segment pays its own subprocess spawns
# through leading_token, command_words, unescape_words and sub_verb, while a
# single long segment pays them once. So the count is bounded too, by
# SEGMENT_MAX, applied after the split in every enforce_* function.
