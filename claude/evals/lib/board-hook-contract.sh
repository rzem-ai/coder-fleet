# Everything above proves the hooks read the right fields and decide the right
# thing. None of it proves the decision reaches the board, because the board
# call is exactly what CLAUDECODE_AGENTS_BOARD=off switches off. These three
# cases run the binary against a throwaway root - never the memory tree - so a
# shim that cannot be found, a status spelling the config does not hold, or a
# comment flag the CLI has renamed is caught here rather than in a real run.
#
# Which board, though. The shim prefers ~/.local/bin/board, which on an
# installed machine is a binary from some earlier build: a branch that changes
# src/cli.ts would be "live-tested" against code it did not write, and a CLI
# regression would pass here and fail in the real run. So when bun is present
# the live pass runs the checkout's own cli.ts through a wrapper and points the
# hook library at it with BOARD_SHIM, which the library honours. Only a machine
# without bun falls back to the shim and whatever it resolves.
