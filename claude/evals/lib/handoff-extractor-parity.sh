# handoff-extractor-parity.sh - hold review-round's handoff reader to the hook's.
#
# There are now three readers of the handoff format in the claudecode-agents repo:
#
#   claudecode-agents/hooks/board-subagent-stop.sh   extract_section   (the board)
#   evals/lib/handoff-check.sh                   the CI validator
#   claudecode-agents/workflows/review-round.js      handoffSection    (the fix loop)
#
# The first two are already pinned to each other by handoff-parity.sh. This
# pins the third. It matters because review-round reads coder's "## Done"
# bullets for the worktree and commit hints and its "## Not done" bullets for
# a finding's disposition, so a reader that disagrees with the hook about what
# an item IS would make the fix loop and the card disagree about the same run.
#
# The two implementations are sliced out of their files rather than
# reimplemented here, so this compares the shipping code and not a copy of it.
# The known-hard cases are the ones the hook spells out and a naive reader gets
# wrong: CRLF (the hook strips every \r), right-trimmed headings ("## Done "
# with a trailing space opens the section - trailing whitespace is invisible
# and never changes meaning), and the None filter's preserved leading
# whitespace ("-  None", two spaces after the dash, is a real item).
#
# Usage:  evals/lib/handoff-extractor-parity.sh [-v]
