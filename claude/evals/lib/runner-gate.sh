# runner-gate.sh - the eval runner must fail when the thing it evaluated failed.

# It used to store the exit code, print a warning, and carry on. If the capture
# happened to contain a valid handoff and the fixture was unchanged, every gate
# passed and the runner exited 0 - so a baseline could be recorded from a run
# that never happened. `final-message.sh` also lifts the `result` string out of
# the envelope without looking at `is_error`, so an error envelope reads as
# ordinary evidence.
#
# The stub below is the review's: one valid handoff, three endings.
#
# Usage:  evals/lib/runner-gate.sh [-v]

# No model is called and nothing is graded - CLAUDE_BIN is a shell script.
