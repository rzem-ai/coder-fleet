# handoff-check.sh - the one check every eval shares.
#
# Three hooks parse the four-heading handoff, so a body that drifts off the
# format breaks the board rather than just reading badly. This is the machine
# reading of `claudecode-agents/skills/handoff/SKILL.md`, applied to the final
# message of an eval run.
#
# It applies the same rules as the production validator in
# `claudecode-agents/hooks/board-subagent-stop.sh`, which is what decides whether a
# real subagent is sent back to re-emit. The two are held identical by
# `evals/lib/handoff-parity.sh`, which runs both over
# `evals/fixtures/handoff-cases/` and fails if their verdicts ever differ.
#
# Usage:  evals/lib/handoff-check.sh <final-message-file>
#
# Give it the final assistant message, not a whole session log: the hook only
# ever sees `last_assistant_message`, so anything wider would fail runs
# production accepts. `run.sh` isolates it before calling this.
#
# Prints one line per check - PASS, FAIL or WARN, then the check id, then what
# it looked at. Exits 0 if every check passed, 1 if any FAILed. WARN never
# fails the run.
#
# Checks:
#   H1  all four headings present, each exactly once
#   H2  the four headings in order, and the handoff is one contiguous block
#   H3  no other level-2 heading anywhere in the message
#   H4  every line in the block is a top-level "- " item, no nesting, no blanks,
#       no fences, no tables
#   H5  no section is empty; an empty section is exactly "- None"
#   H6  every Decisions needed line is Blocker:, Propose item: or Propose memory:
#   H7  nothing follows the last item of Decisions needed
#   H8  no typed line - Blocker:, Propose item:, Propose memory: - under any
#       heading other than Decisions needed
#   H9  (warn) no item much over 200 characters
